A [rotation-invariant cloud clusering (RICC)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9497325) is a data-driven unsupervised learning apporoach 
that leverages rotaion-invariant autoencoder and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to automate the clustering of cloud patterns and textures 
without any assumptions concerning artitifical cloud categories.  
RICC works with three different source of [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/) from Aqua and Terra.
